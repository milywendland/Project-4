## **Description**

#### Ikimono is inspired by everyone's favorite digital pet, the Tamagotchi. In Ikimono, you have a pet that you can feed, play with, and walk, just like Tamagotchi. Ikimono means Creature in Japanese, so I wanted all of the pets to be creatures from Japanese folklore or inpsired by Japanese culture.

### **Technologies Used**

- Mongoose
- Express
- React
- Node

### **Getting Started**

#### To get started I will build out my react app "shell" and then start creating my database. I'll have to make some basic 8-bit style sprites for the pets, and make a little console for them to live in. Then build out the game mechanics. I'm hoping to use OAuth for this project, since we already used JWT Auth for a previous project. I think it'll be good to learn something else. As a stretch goal, I'd like to have sounds that the pet makes when you feed them or play with them.
